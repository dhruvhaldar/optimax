## 2024-05-23 - [Information Leakage via Exception Handling]
**Vulnerability:** The backend API endpoints were catching all exceptions with `try...except Exception as e:` and returning the raw error message to the client (`detail=str(e)`). This exposed internal implementation details, such as `scipy` or `pulp` error messages, which could potentially leak system paths or sensitive data, and provided attackers with information about the backend technology stack.
**Learning:** Developers often use broad exception handlers to quickly debug issues during development, but forget to sanitize messages for production. In scientific computing APIs (like this one using `scipy`), `ValueError` often maps to user input errors (e.g., matrix dimension mismatch), while other exceptions are typically system errors.
**Prevention:** Use FastAPI's `@app.exception_handler` to globally handle exceptions. Map known safe exceptions (like `ValueError` for bad input) to generic 400 responses with sanitized messages. Catch all other exceptions as 500 "Internal Server Error" and log the full traceback server-side only. Do not rely on `try...except` blocks in individual route handlers unless specific recovery logic is needed.

## 2024-10-24 - [Unbounded Input Size (DoS)]
**Vulnerability:** Pydantic models for mathematical solvers (`List[float]`, `List[List[float]]`) accepted lists of arbitrary size. This could allow an attacker to send massive matrices, causing memory exhaustion (OOM) or excessive CPU usage in the backend solvers (`scipy`, `pulp`), leading to a Denial of Service.
**Learning:** Type hints like `List[float]` validate the *type* of elements but not the *quantity*. For computational endpoints, explicit bounds are critical to protect resources.
**Prevention:** Use `Annotated[List[T], Field(max_length=N)]` (Pydantic v2) or `conlist` (Pydantic v1) to enforce strict size limits on all list inputs.
